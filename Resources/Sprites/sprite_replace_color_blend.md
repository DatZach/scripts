sprite_replace_color_blend
==========================

Warning: This script is already slow but a [bug] in GameMaker:Studio
makes it pretty much unusable. The sprite below took 46 minutes to 
process. It should have taken about 30 seconds.

![sprite_replace_color_blend()](/images/sprite_replace_color_blend.gif "sprite_replace_color_blend()")

Warning: This function is slow. VERY SLOW. It is only suitable for 
small sprites with few frames. It is probably far too slow to be used 
in your game. But it does have its uses. You have been warned.

Note: A much faster script for color replacement (without color blending) 
is [sprite_replace_color()](/script/sprite_replace_color).

script: sprite_replace_color_blend.gml
