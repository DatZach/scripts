sprite_replace_color_blend
==========================

Warning: This script has not yet been ported to GameMaker:Studio

Warning: This function is slow. VERY SLOW. It is only suitable for 
small sprites with few frames. It is probably far too slow to be used 
in your game. But it does have its uses. You have been warned.

Note: A much faster script for color replacement (without color blending) 
is [sprite_replace_color()](/script/sprite_replace_color).

script: sprite_replace_color_blend.gml
