> Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, 
> as pronounced in English. The goal is for names with the same 
> pronunciation to be encoded to the same representation so that 
> they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling.
> Using this algorithm, both "Robert" and "Rupert" return the same 
> string "R163" while "Rubin" yields "R150".
